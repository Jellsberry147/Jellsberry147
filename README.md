### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I've been learning Web Development since Novemember 2021, and am having a great time finding all of the different ways to use these skills! I plan to focus on making standard websites for the foreseeable future, but games and other forms of interactive content are next on my radar! For now I'm more geared towards Frontend development, but I have some experience from a lot of different disciplines. Java, C++ and Python are the main OOP languages I've done some work with, and SQL and I have a love-hate relationship (I love it, it hates me). 



Outside of my career and educational ambitions, I have a few dozen other ways to pursue my creative side.

-I love flying my DJI and getting to see the world I'm familiar with from such cool angles, and from so high up

-I love all things 3D printing! I've recently started learning to 3D model and have made a couple device mounts and upgrades around the house

-I have a lot of fun making real-world games to play with friends and family, some of which I hope to adapt to be able to play online with friends from around the world

-I recently started Geocaching and have been gradually expanding the radius of my conquest :) It's so fun being on the hunt for the strange ways people hide caches, and getting inspired for when I finally start placing them myself

-I've been spending a few hours a week at the local gym to stay in shape and give my body the exercise it needs

-I'm a tinkerer at heart. I like to work on and upgrade/customize my car, my Switch, and save money by never needing to hire a handyman :D
